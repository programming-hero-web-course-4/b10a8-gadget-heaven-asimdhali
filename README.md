## ⚛️ React Fundamental Concepts Used  

1. **Components**: Divided the UI into reusable and independent components like `Details`, `Dashboard`, etc.  
2. **Props and State**: Used props to pass data and state to manage the dynamic behavior of the application.  
3. **Context API**: Managed shared data for the cart and wishlist across components.  
4. **Hooks**:  
   - `useState`: For managing local state like toggles and data updates.  
   - `useContext`: For accessing and manipulating shared data using `CartContext` and `WishlistContext`.  
   - `useEffect`: For side effects like updating the document title dynamically.  
5. **Routing**: Used `react-router-dom` for navigation between pages such as the homepage, product details, and dashboard.

## 🗂️ Data Handling and Management  

- **Context API**: Used to manage global state for the cart and wishlist, enabling seamless data sharing across components.  
- **Local Storage**: Not used in this project (can be implemented for persistence).
